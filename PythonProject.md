# Objective: This script begins creating the ArcGIS Pro data set I use for my research on Massachusetts single-family property sales from 2002-2019. 

To do this, I used the help support on the ArcGIS Pro to find what commands are used for what functions. The primary benefit of doing this is that now I have a record of my steps in creating the data set.

I plan to continue to add to this script as I continue to build up this data set.
